Dizziness started about 1 week ago, linked to neck symptoms. Bilateral arm and leg weakness noticed in the last couple of weeks, coinciding with the increase in dizziness.\n*   **Location:** Neck stiffness is primarily at the base of the skull, extending into the shoulders and occasionally the upper back. No radiation of pain, tingling, or numbness into the arms or hands.\n*   **Character of Neck Stiffness:** Described as a constant, dull ache, tight, deep soreness, and a persistent throb. It significantly limits cervical range of motion, particularly when turning the head.\n*   **Character of Dizziness:** Described as lightheadedness and unsteadiness, not a spinning sensation. It is strongly linked to neck movement and stiffness.\n*   **Character of Weakness:** Arms and legs feel \""heavy,\"" requiring more effort for activities like carrying groceries. Legs feel \""wobbly,\"" especially on uneven ground, contributing to unsteadiness. It is bilateral and intermittent, occurring with activity.\n*   **Aggravating Factors:** Neck stiffness and dizziness are worsened by quick head movements (e.g., looking over the shoulder), prolonged sitting at a computer or reading, and looking upwards.\n*   **Alleviating Factors:** Lying flat on the back provides some relief for neck stiffness. Resting the head and staying still helps calm the dizziness.\n*   **Severity:** Neck pain is rated 7/10 at its worst. Dizziness is rated 6/10 when severe.\n*   **Associated Symptoms:** New onset of bilateral arm and leg weakness and unsteadiness. No fever, chills, unexplained weight changes, or changes in vision or hearing reported.\n\n**Patient Information:** 46-year-old female, describes weight as \""a bit heavier than I should be.\"" Exercises by walking 20-30 minutes a couple of times per week and performs light morning stretching. Occupation is an administrative assistant, involving prolonged sitting at a desk.\n\n**Past Medical History:** History of occasional lower back pain, manageable with conservative measures. No other diagnosed medical conditions. Has experienced mild, transient neck stiffness in the past, but not of this duration or intensity, and without associated dizziness or weakness.\n\n**Medications:** Daily multivitamin. Occasional ibuprofen for back pain, but not regularly for current neck symptoms.\n\n**Allergies:** No known allergies.\n\n**Family History:** No significant family history of major illnesses or conditions similar to the patient's current complaints. Parents are generally healthy.\n\n**Social History:** Non-smoker. Rarely consumes alcohol (occasional glass of wine). Denies recreational drug use.\n\n**Vital Signs:** Not measured recently by the patient. No subjective complaints of fever or abnormal heart rate.\n\nNo additional documents provided.""",Cervical spondylosis,24

Dizziness requires waiting it out.\n*   **Radiation:** Cervicalgia occasionally radiates into the shoulders.\n*   **Timing:** Cervicalgia is constant but worsens with specific activities. Dizziness is intermittent but becoming more frequent.\n*   **Severity:** Cervicalgia rated 5-6/10 on average, escalating to 8-9/10 with aggravating movements.
