It appeared like two days ago. 
It happens when I take deep breaths, sniff or laugh. The deeper the sniffs, breaths and laughs the deeper the pain, I feel it should be something in the nervous system.
The pain is sharp, It's deep inside, it radiates from the stomach to the shoulder (trapezium).
It's like a 5 at the worst point, the pain worsen after I finish a meal, not because something inside my stomach but because my stomach dilates and I feel that has something to do with it.
No, no other symptoms, and I've never felt this before.
No, no chronical diseases. I've been taking the Brazilian painkiller anti-flamatory Torsilax, and that significantly relieves the pain.
